These are my dotfiles, feel free to stea... I mean reuse stuff that you find here as I've done with other's dotfiles as well.

Everything in this repo assumes you will install (git clone) to ~/.dotfiles and you have zsh and oh-my-zsh installed on your computer.

Prerequisites:

 * Xcode
  * command line tools (which includes GCC)

 * Homebrew
  * Python
  * tmux
  * vim
  * Git/Mercurial
  * GNU coreutils
  * ZSH

 * Python (via pip)
   * virtualenv
   * virtualenvwrapper

 * Iterm2
   * Don't set background transparency, this will change background vs. arrow color
